            We are involved in many ways in order to build a better environment in tech for everyone. Two years ago we
            became <strong>Diversity Sponsor</strong> of
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1817732114/the-phpdiversity-rainbow-elephpant">The PHPDiversity Rainbow Elephpant campaign on Kickstarter</a>
            when the project was seemingly about to end without making it. We are very proud that many others followed us and that the project reached
            its goal.

            As we want to do more we are pleased to announce our <strong>Scholarships for phpDay 2020</strong>.
            We are committed to enabling as many people as possible to attend our conference, and to promoting an
            inclusive community; last year we introduced a ticket scholarship scheme (no travel) to encourage students,
            under-represented groups and those who can’t otherwise afford tickets to experience the event.
        </p>
        <p class="row__column">
            Preference will be given to members of under-represented groups in technology - women, minorities, LGBTQIA+,
            people with disabilities, or other under-represented groups; but consideration will be given to anybody who
            would otherwise be unable to attend without financial assistance.
        </p>

        <p class="row__column">
            These scholarships are made possible thanks to our <strong>Diversity Support Tickets</strong> initiative
            and the support received by <a href="http://www.grusp.org/it/">GrUSP</a>.
